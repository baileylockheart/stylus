# Stylus Themes by Bailey Lockheart
Stylus is a browser extension that allows you to change the themeing of a website! These are some themes that I've made! All you have to do is:

- Install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
- And take a look through these themes, and see if they're what you'd like!

# Themes ♥
## Pink and Purple [Threads]
![pink and purple threads theme preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileylockheart/stylus/main/images/pink-and-purple-threads.png)
A pink and purple theme, best used in Threads's light mode! This is the first theme I made, and it’s the one I personally use! I used my brand kit/personal aesthetic to make it, so I really like it.

## Forest [Threads]

A theme based on forest colors, best used in Threads's dark mode! While it’s relatively low contrast, I think this one came out pretty nice!

A theme based on Tumblr's Vampire theme, best used in Threads's dark mode! Some of my moots on Threads are into Twilight, so I thought this would be fun to make ^-^

## Canary [Threads]
![canary threads theme preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileylockheart/stylus/main/images/canary-threads.png)
A theme based on Tumblr's Canary theme, best used in Threads's light mode! I already made a handful of dark themes, so I wanted to make another option :’) Be warned, polls are a little weird with this one.

![pink and purple soundgasm theme preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileylockheart/stylus/main/images/pink-and-purple-soundgasm.png)
A pink and purple theme for Soundgasm! I got a liiiittle bit annoyed with how empty the UI looked, so I decided to make it a little nicer :D

## Pink and Black [Tumblr] [Tweaked]
![pink and black tumblr tweaked theme preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baileylockheart/stylus/main/images/pink-and-black-tumblr-tweaked.png)
A fork of "pink and black tumblr" by lesbianism! I loved the color palette of the [original theme](https://userstyles.world/style/12955/pink-and-black-tumblr), but there were a few elements I wanted to change about Tumblr, itself, and a few things that I wanted to color, as well!
